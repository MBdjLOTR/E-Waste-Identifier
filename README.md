# E waste Identifier

A mobile application built with Flutter that empowers users to identify electronic waste through intelligent image recognition. Simply capture a photo of any e-waste item using your device camera, and the app leverages Google's ML Kit with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically classify the waste type.
The app integrates with Google's machine learning APIs to provide real-time identification of electronics like smartphones, laptops, batteries, circuit boards, and other electronic components. Once identified, it retrieves comprehensive information about the detected e-waste item, including proper disposal methods, recycling guidelines, environmental impact data, and nearby collection centers.
Key Features:

Camera integration for instant e-waste capture
CNN-powered image classification using Google ML Kit
Real-time waste identification and categorization
Detailed information retrieval for each identified item
Disposal and recycling recommendations
Environmental impact awareness
User-friendly Flutter interface for cross-platform compatibility

Perfect for environmentally conscious users, recycling centers, and organizations promoting sustainable e-waste management practices.
